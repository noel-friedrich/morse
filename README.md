# MorseLife
> Being lazy is ok. Having to check your phone every time someone texts you is not ok. So why not let the phone tell you the text via morse code directly out of your pocket (via vibration motor)

## Morse Training

> The App includes a small Training Section where you can practise understanding morse code
